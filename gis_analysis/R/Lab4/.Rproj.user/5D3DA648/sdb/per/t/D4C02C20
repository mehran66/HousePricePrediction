The police argue that individuals and neighborhoods are targeted because certain \"types\" of people are more likely to engage in criminal activity. This type of profiling and the tactics used by police have come under intense public scrutiny. Sophisticated statistical analyses ([Gelman et al. 2007](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/frisk9.pdf)) report that in New York City racial minorities are stopped disproportionately by police (even *after* accounting for local variations in crime rates and prevalence of different groups to be caught for committing crime). The central question, in statistical debates is, \"are the police acting based upon data or racial/cultural bias\"?\n\nMany cities have started to publish crime statistics. These allow citizens to see limited information about each crime recorded by the city's police department, typically the location, date, and type of crime. The public discourse around police use of profiling (and physically aggressive tactics) often lacks nuance. On the one hand it seems reasonable to expect police to use data to inform their strategies and tactics, on the other hand its seems entirely unjust to target individuals and places (with force that may be excessive) simply because of their racial and/or econmoic characteristics.\n\nIn this lab you will tackle the following questions:\n\n* At the neighborhood level does one type of profile apply to all types of crimes?\n* Does the neighborhood (tract) “profile” for crime vary for different types of crimes? \n* Are certain neighborhood-level attributes routinely associated with crime prevalence?\n\nIn this lab you will be using crime data, provided by the city of Chicago and Census Tract Level data from the American Community Survey. [Download data here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xe77fjd0i4lypf8/Data.zip?dl=1). A few words of caution, [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) may be a major and unavoidable problem in your analysis. This makes it difficult to directly compare model coefficients. A conservative approach to multicollinearity is to structure models in such a way that you never have to directly interpret coefficients. For example, only talking about the model in the aggregate (\"the $R^2$ for model 2 is better than the one for model 1\"). However, this is unsatisfying and difficult to communicate to policy makers. An alternative approach, that is slightly less conservative, is to control multicollinearity as much as possible and discuss the significance and sign of individual coefficients (but not their magnitudes). How you present your models is a matter of personal judgement.\n\n## Getting staring\n\nThe data we will be working with is inherently spatial, the tract-level data from both the city and the Census describes places. Thus maps are a convenient way to visualize both the inputs and outputs to our analysis. Visualizing spatial data is fairly easy in `R`, however making a proper map (with marginalia) is really time consuming. We will be \"mapping\" things in `R`, but this term is used quite loosely; the basic maps made in this lab would make most properly trained cartographers squirm and avert their eyes!\n\nWe have to load a few libraries for handling and visualizing spatial data.\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(maptools)  # Guess what this packahe is for? for creating maps:)\n# Load a map and data for Chicago\n# These are stored in the \"shapefile\" format\nchicago = readShapePoly(\"Data/ChicagoCrime.shp\")\n```\n\nThe chicago object you just created is a `SpatialDataFrame`, this is a type of `R` object that contains spatial data (points, lines, or polygons) and the attributes of each element in the data. Working with spatial data frames is slightly different from working with regular data.frames, spatial data.frames have a lot of different pieces. You can see these pieces by typing `head(chicago)` but this gives reams of hard to digest output. `SpatialDataFrames` are organized using a series of 'slots' to hold data, geometry, projection, and other information necessary for drawing maps. You can see the names of these slots by typing `slotNames(chicago)`.\n\n`SpatialDataFrames` have special behavior, if you use the `plot()` function they draw a map. This map only shows the outlines of the polygons (or points/lines) that contain data. Visualizing data on the map requires a few more steps (see below).\n\n```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nplot(chicago)\n```\n\nIf you want to see only the data you have to access the 'data' slot. This is done using the `@` symbol and typing the name of the slot you want to access. For example, `chicago@data` provides access to the data.frame describing all census tracts in Chicago. You can work with `chicago@data` just like you would work with a regular data.frame (Note: you might want to create a separate `chdata` data.frame object by doing `chdata = chicago@data` later).\n\nOne of the things you'll immediately notice about the Chicago data is that the column names are all truncated to 10 characters. This makes it very hard to understand what each variable stores. This is a legacy of the shapefile format, which (stupidly) is incapable of storing column names of more than 10 characters. We'll rename the columns so it's easier to tell what we are working with. You can print the list of variable names for any data frame by typing `names(df_name)`.\n\n```{r}\n# Read in a readable list of variable names (this was created by hand).  \n# Note the use of \":\" as a column delimiter...\n# If names are too verbose for your liking edit them in the text file prior to importing\nvar_names = read.table(\"Data/Variable Descriptions.txt\", sep=\":\", strip.white=TRUE)\n\n# Attach the modified names to the chicago data\nnames(chicago@data) = as.character(var_names[, 2])\n```\n\n## Making Maps in R\n\nDrawing a map in `R` is way more complicated than it needs to be. This lab will present a simple method for making thematic maps, this method, because it is simple, doesn't allow nuanced control of visual variables. The most robust methods for creating maps involve the use of the package `lattice` and the function `spplot()` or the use of the `ggplot` library and the `fortify()` function (We'll learn more about `ggplot` in future labs).\n\n(**Note**: You may encounter some trouble using the `fortify()` function. If running `fortify()` returns a permission error message, you'll need to install and load an additional package, `rgeos`, to get it working properly. Ask your TA if you need assistance with this.)   \n\nThe process for making simple maps in `R` is as follows:\n\n* Choose a variable to map, divide that variable into categories (typically 3-7 categories are used for thematic maps). For example a variable like `income` could be divided into categories `for 0-$10,000; $10,000-$20,000; $20,000-$30,000` and so on. To do this use function `cut` or `classIntervals`, in this lab we will use `classIntervals`.\n* Choose a palette that has the same number of colors as the variable does categories. If you created 4 income groups choose a palette with 4 colors. To aid in color selection we will use the `RColorBrewer` library (which is based on the famouse [ColorBrewer website](http://colorbrewer2.org)).\n* Attach the colors to the categories and draw the map.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(classInt)  # Library for creating clases\n# Create Categories based on quantiles\ncats7 = classIntervals(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes, n=7, style=\"quantile\")\n```\n\nNow we have to choose a color to use to describe the categories.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n# Display all palettes\n# display.brewer.all() \n\n# Lets use this one\n# display.brewer.pal(7, \"YlGnBu\")\n\n# Save palette as an object\npal7 = brewer.pal(7, \"YlGnBu\") \n```\n\nThe last step is to attach the palette to the categories and draw the map.\n\n```{r}\nseven_cols = findColours(cats7, pal7) \n\n# Draw map using specificed data and colors\n# lty=0 (line type) turns off tract borders\nplot(chicago, col=seven_cols, lty=0)\n```\n\n1. In thinking about the previous map, what can we do to reduce the impact of plotting potential outliers (think in terms of density and variation in populations)?\n    * Create a crime density map. What variables are required here?\n    ```{r}\n    # normalizing the income by deviding to Area of each Tract \n    cats7_perarea = classIntervals(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes / chicago$Area_of_Tract_ , n=7, style=\"quantile\")\n    seven_cols = findColours(cats7_perarea, pal7) \n    plot(chicago, col=seven_cols, lty=0)\n    \n       # normalizing the income by deviding to the population of each tract ((chicago$Population_Density * chicago$Area_of_Tract_)) \n    cats7_perarea = classIntervals(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes / (chicago$Population_Density * chicago$Area_of_Tract_), n=7, style=\"quantile\")\n    seven_cols = findColours(cats7_perarea, pal7) \n    plot(chicago, col=seven_cols, lty=0)\n    ```\n    * Why is density a potentially more useful way to visualize crime?\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"\n    Desity of crime is a more reliable representation of crime in the map because \na tract with high/low number of crimes cannot be interpreted as a hot/cold spot crime in the map or vice versa. The crime number should be devided by area (or more appropriately by population) to be better representative of crime pattern in the map.\n    \"\n    ```\n\n2. The next thing we want to do is *explore* our data more. Start by taking a look at the distribution of the variable `Number_of_violent_crimes`. What do you notice? Are there any outliers?\n    * Create a plot that will help to identify outliers.\n    ```{r}\n    boxplot(chicago@data$Number_of_violent_crimes)\n    \"Based on the box plot of Number_of_violent_crimes, it seems that there are some \noutliers in the data\"\n    ```\n    * What might be reasons for these outliers (list some)?\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"These outliers can have several reasons:\n     - The population of a those tracts are much higher than the other tracts and so it make sense to observe more crime\n     - Maybe there is a racial/cultural bias in the neigborhood for which the crime is reported\n     - Maybe that is not an actual outlier and the crime rate is really high in a neighborhood\n    Note: I think outlier is not a ggod term here because the probably the extreme values are not wrong data, and they just should be normalized to be interpreted\"\n    \n    ```\n    * Create a new variable called `adj_violent_crimes` that 'adjusts' for potential outliers.\n    ```{r}\n    chicago$adj_violent_crimes = sqrt(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes)\n    ```\n    * Square root transforms (used above) are one means of transforming the response variable. Try several alternative transformations (log, exp, etc) and examine the distribution of the transformed response variable. Choose one that you feel performs most effectively and reassign it to `chicago$adj_violent_crimes`. (It's fine to keep the square root transform, but justify the choice if you do).\n    ```{r, fig.align='center'}\n    par(mfrow=c(3,2))\n    # SQRT \n    hist(sqrt(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes), col=\"gray\")\n    boxplot(sqrt(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes),            \n            col=\"gray\", \n            ylab = \"sqrt(Number of violent crimes)\", \n            main = \"Box plot of sqrt(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes)\")\n    # LOG\n    hist(log(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes), col=\"gray\")\n    boxplot(log(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes),            \n            col=\"gray\", \n            ylab = \"log(Number of violent crimes)\", \n            main = \"Box plot of log(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes)\")\n    # EXP\n    hist(exp(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes), col=\"gray\")\n    boxplot(exp(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes),            \n            col=\"gray\", \n            ylab = \"exp(Number of violent crimes)\", \n            main = \"Box plot of exp(chicago$Number_of_violent_crimes)\")\n    ```\n    * Explain why you chose the adjustment you did (choose one of `sqrt`, `log`, or `exp`).\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"\n    I chose SQRT because the distribution of the transformed data is nearly normal and data is evenly distributed based on the box plot as well. The distribution of LOG also is close to normal, but it is a bit skewed, and it seems that SQRT works a bit better for this dara.\n    \"\n    ```\n\n## Multiple Regression\n\nNow we want to fit models to predict the association between neighborhood level socioeconomic characteristics and crime. This is an academic exercise but it reflects many real world situations, where one is faced with a large set of potential models to answer a somewhat vague policy/empirical question.\n\nFor example, the model below (which has an adjusted R-square of about 0.5), has a selection of variables that *might* be associated with the prevalence of violent crime:\n\n```{r}\nmod1 = lm(adj_violent_crimes ~ Population_Density + \n          Percent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household + \n          Percent_of_households_with_no_car +  \n          Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_ + \n          Percent_with_a_Graduate_Degree_ + \n          Percent_Black_Alone +\n          Median_House_Value +\n          Median_Rent_ +\n          Income_Gini_Coefficient_,\n          data=chicago@data)\n```\n\n3. It is important to do diagnostics on the model to make sure that it is not violating any key assumptions.\n  * Produce a histogram and scatterplot of the above model's residuals.\n    ```{r}\n    hist(resid(mod1))\n    plot(resid(mod1) ~ predict(mod1))\n    abline(0, 0) # the horizon\n    ```\n  * Are there any major issues that we should be concerend about?\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \" No, Here is the checklist:\n\nheteroskedasticity (non-constant variance): The residuals roughly form a horizontal band around the 0 line. This suggests that the variances of the error terms are equal.\n\ninfluential observations (possible outliers): there are a few outlires, but their value is not very large and cannot be considered a major issue. But in general non of them do  stands out from the basic random pattern of residuals. \n\npattern: There is not any pattern in the plot and The residuals bounce randomly around the 0 line. This suggests that the assumption that the relationship is linear is reasonable.\n    \"\n    ```\n\n4. It's also useful to check for spatial patterns in the residuals from the model. Is the model performing well in some areas but not in others? To do this we'll have to map the residuals.\n    * Produce a map of model residuals similar to the first map of the response variable. This time, use the 'jenks' classification style, and the `\"YlOrRd\" color palette (with 5 classes).\n\n    ```{r }\n    # Jenks categories of residuals\n    cats5 = classIntervals(resid(mod1),  n=5, style=\"jenks\")\n    \n    # Five class color palette\n    pal5 = brewer.pal(5, \"YlOrRd\") \n    \n    # Attach colors to categories\n    five_cols = findColours(cats5, pal5)\n    \n    # Plot map\n    plot(chicago, col=five_cols, lty=0)\n    ```\n    * Do the residuals seem spatially random?\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"Yes, the residuals seem spatially random, and no pattern can be seen in the residual map\"\n    ```\n    * To give you something to compare to, if we omit most variables from the model we will see spatial patterns in the residuals, as shown below for the model `adj_violent_crimes ~ Population_Density`:\n    ```{r}\n    # Basic model\n    m = lm(adj_violent_crimes ~ Population_Density, data=chicago@data)\n\n    # Jenks categories of residuals\n    cats5 = classIntervals(resid(m),  n=5, style=\"jenks\")\n    \n    # Five class color palette\n    pal5 = brewer.pal(5, \"YlOrRd\") \n    \n    # Attach colors to categories\n    five_cols = findColours(cats5, pal5)\n    \n    # Plot map\n    plot(chicago, col=five_cols, lty=0)\n    ```\n    \nWhen the residuals from a model show clear spatial patterns there is evidence of some sort of missing variable, this is sometimes called 'model mispecification'. The patterns in the model residuals suggest some variable or variables, missing from the model, are strongly related to the outcome of interest. For example, the plot shown below plots the residuals from the minimalist model above against percent African-American. Two things are striking in this plot:\n\n  * Chicago is a highly segregated city, most tracts are either more than 80% black or less than 20% black.\n  * The model tends to overpredict in places with a low percent African-American and underpredict in places with a high proportion African-American.  \n    ```{r echo=FALSE}\n    plot(chicago@data$Percent_Black_Alone, resid(m), xlab=\"Residuals\", ylab=\"Percent Black Alone\")\n    abline(h=0, col=\"red\", lwd=2)\n    ```\n\nIt's also important to check models for multicollinearity. This is done by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) as follows:\n\n```{r}\nmod1 = lm(adj_violent_crimes ~ Population_Density + \n          Percent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household + \n          Percent_of_households_with_no_car +  \n          Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_ + \n          Percent_with_a_Graduate_Degree_ + \n          Percent_Black_Alone +\n          Median_House_Value +\n          Median_Rent_ +\n          Income_Gini_Coefficient_,\n          data=chicago@data)\n\nlibrary(car)\nvif(mod1)\n```\n\n5. The VIFs for female headed households, less than high school education, and percent black alone are not good. However, VIF 'cutoffs' are subjective...\n  * Go online and research a good/common 'cutoff' for VIF measures and provide your source. Use this 'cutoff' to assess the collinearity of the above model.\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"\n    The cutoff is 2.5, and  we should be concern when a VIF is greater than 2.50.\n    \n    refrences: \n    http://statisticalhorizons.com/multicollinearity\n    http://psychologicalstatistics.blogspot.com/2013/11/multicollinearity-and-collinearity-in.html\n    \n    Also based on another source, we can use this: sqrt(vif(fit)) > 2\n    http://www.statmethods.net/stats/rdiagnostics.html\n    \"\n    ```\n    \n```{r, fig.align='center'}\n    mod1_variables = data.frame(poulationDensity  = chicago@data$Population_Density, singleFemaleHeaded = chicago@data$Percent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household, noCar = chicago@data$Percent_of_households_with_no_car, LessThanHighSchool = chicago@data$Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_, aGraduateDegree = chicago@data$Percent_with_a_Graduate_Degree_, BlackAlone = chicago@data$Percent_Black_Alone, HouseValue = chicago@data$Median_House_Value, Rent = chicago@data$Median_Rent_, Gini = chicago@data$Income_Gini_Coefficient_)\n\n\n    mod1_variables_corr = cor(mod1_variables, use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\") # get correlations\n    \n    library('corrplot') #package corrplot\n    corrplot(mod1_variables_corr, method = \"circle\", addCoef.col = \"black\") #plot matrix\n \n#So, based on the correlation matrix, female headed households, less than high school education, and percent black are highly correlated.   \n```\n\n  * It is possible that these three variables are correlated with each other, by dropping *two* we may be able to improve the model.\n    ```{r}\n    mod1_red = lm(adj_violent_crimes ~ Population_Density + \n                 Percent_of_households_with_no_car +  \n                 Percent_with_a_Graduate_Degree_ + \n                 Percent_Black_Alone +\n                 Median_House_Value +\n                 Median_Rent_ +\n                 Income_Gini_Coefficient_,\n                 data=chicago@data)\n\n    vif(mod1_red)\n    ```\n  * Do you notice an improvement in VIFs?\n    ```{r eval=F}\n    \"\n    Yes, now there is not any VIF value greater than 2.5\n    \"\n    ```\n  * Perform an ANOVA test of these two nested models. Compare the full and reduced forms of the model.\n    ```{r}\n    # it tests whether reduction in the residual sum of squares are statistically significant or not\n    anova(mod1, mod1_red)\n    \n    # So based on the p-value reduction in the residual sum of squares are not statistically significant, and the reduced model would be fine\n    ```\n    \nAs a final diagnostic we might want to examine the marginal contribution of each variable to the model, its 'extra sum of squares'. The `modelEffectSizes` function in the `lmSupport` library provides partial R-Squared values, which it calls the `pEta-sqr`. We see that the percent black alone variable has the highest partial R-square but we previously saw that race was correlated with other factors that might be related to violent crime. Should we have dropped race from the model and included education and female headed households? Understanding that race is an important factor for violent crime prevalence in Chicago is an important insight, but this should be tempered by the fact that race, as we saw, is highly correlated with other factors that are also associated with crime. Its very hard, many would say impossible, to make causal statements using a model like this. Causal statments would be of the nature, \"a X% rise in the number of single parent female headed households causes a rise of X in the number of crimes.\" There is a maixm in statistics, \"there is no causation without manipulation\", that is, you can't establish causal relationships without experimental manipulation. In the social sciences \"manipulations\" are expensive, ethically complicated, and rarely done. This may not be the case in the physical sciences.\n\nWe can examine the marginal contribution of each variable to the model, that is, its impact on the model given that all other variables are already in the model:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lmSupport)  # You'll probably need to install this one\n# Think seriously about what we are measuring here (read the package help for more details)\n# When talking about these results, break down this test in terms of effect sizes...\nmodelEffectSizes(mod1_red)\n```\n\n## Deliverables\n\nFor this lab you have to make 4 regression models (you've already done one!). One model should be for violent crime (the variable used in the demonstration), the other three variables can be any type of crime selected from the Chicago data. For each model:\n\n  * Select variables that you hypothesize are associated with the outcome type of crime.\n  * Map the dependent variable (a type of crime)\n  * Develop a model by building it incrementally (using forward or backward selection). Test nested versions of the same model. Check residual plots, check for multicollinearity, examine the partial R-Square for each variable. Look at AIC, $R^2$, ANOVA, and any other diagnostics you can think of (see class notes).\n  * Interpret the model. Pay special attention to the sign and significance of each variable. Do the predictors align with your intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the frequency of crime?\n\n### Things to keep in mind\nOverall, do you notice any patterns across your four models? Are certain variables routinely associated with crime? Be careful in your interpretation of model coefficients. Why do you think these factors seem associated with crime? For example, in the model above we say that percent black was the most influential predictor of violent crime frequency. I wonder what the race variable is actually measuring, could it be a proxy for other variables that are highly correlated with the racial composition of neighborhoods and also influence crime?

In order to determine how much of the variance in different types of crime could be explained by independent variables, four multiple linear regression models were built and evaluated.  \n____________________________________________________________________\n## Functions\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n\n# classify and map features\nmapClassifyFeatures <- function(Data, inputVar, numClasses, type, color ){\n  \n  library(maptools)\n  \n  library(classInt)  # Library for creating clases\n  # Create Categories based on quantiles\n  cats = classIntervals(inputVar, n=numClasses, style= type)\n  library(RColorBrewer)\n  # Save palette as an object\n  pal = brewer.pal(numClasses, color) \n  cols = findColours(cats, pal) \n  \n  # Draw map using specificed data and colors\n  # lty=0 (line type) turns off tract borders\n  plot(chicago, col=cols, lty=0)\n}\n\n```\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n## Model one\n\n### 1 - Variable Selection\n- How do the explanatory variables you chose reflect the crime type you are modeling? \n```{r eval=F}\n```\n\n### 2 - Descriptive Statistics/Data Visualization\n- Summarize the data and/or provide a few visualizations (maps, plots).

Pay special attention to the sign and significance of each variable. Do the predictors align with your intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the frequency of crime?\n\n```{r eval=F}\n\" To explain our crime type (number of violent crime, we came up with three variable that can explain the variation of out moeld better. 1) Median House Value: this variable is not very significant, but has a negative coefficient, and so its increase leads to decreasing in the number of violent crime, that is based on my prediction in the begining. 2) Percent of children in single female  headed household is the second significant variable in our model and with a positive coefficient has a direct relationship with number of violent crime. This predictor also align with my intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the number of violent crime. 3) Drug Abuse is the most significant variabel of this model. It has a positive coefficient that makes sense.\n\"\n```\n7-2- What shortcomings does your final model have? In what ways is the model's explanatory power limited? Does the model still violate assumptions of OLS regression (i.e. heteroskedasticity, residual [spatial]autocorrelation)? (Explain how these problems limit your ability to draw inferences about the crime type you chose.) How might the characteristics of the variables you chose influence these problems? [*]\n```{r eval=F}\n\"\nOur final model has a R-square of 0.6768 that is considered fine in a linear regression model, but still the results are not completly satisfying. First of all, it seems that the relationship between the the number of violent crime and drug dbuse, which is the most significant variabel of our model, is not linear. Making this assumption that we have only linear relationships resulted in homoscedasticity and autocorrelated residuals in our model.

Pay special attention to the sign and significance of each variable. Do the predictors align with your intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the frequency of crime?\n\n```{r eval=F}\n\" To explain our crime type (number of Vehicle Theft, we came up with four variable that can explain the variation of our model better. \n1) Population_Density: this variable is significant, its increase leads to increasing in the number of violent crime. 2) Liquor_License is a fine variable in our model and with a positive coefficient has a direct relationship with number of Vehicle Theft. This predictor also align with my intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the number of Vehicle_Theft. 3) vandalism was the most statistically significant variable of this model. This may be due to vehicle theft and vandalism as co-occurring events, as well as increasing escalation of crimes and/or opportunity for crime. 4) Finally, Drug_Abuse that although is not a significant variable but differnet tests proved that it's an effective variable in our model. \n\"\n```\n7-2- What shortcomings does your final model have? In what ways is the model's explanatory power limited? Does the model still violate assumptions of OLS regression (i.e. heteroskedasticity, residual [spatial]autocorrelation)? (Explain how these problems limit your ability to draw inferences about the crime type you chose.) How might the characteristics of the variables you chose influence these problems? [*]\n```{r eval=F}\n\"\nOur final model has a R-square of 0.5054 that is considered fine in a linear regression model, but still the results are not completly satisfying. First of all, still there are outliers in our residuals. It seems that deleting outliers in not an straight forward process. Also we still have heteroscedasticity and correlated residuals in our model. After examining the plots of residuals vs variables, the residuals for vandalism does not bounce randomly around the 0 line, it suggests that the assumption that the relationship is linear is not reasonable. But I ploted vandalism and Vehicle Theft together and it's clear that they have a very strong linear relationship. I do not know what is exactly the reason of this issue.\n\"\n```\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n## Model Three: Burglary\n\n### 1 - Variable Selection\n1-1- How do the explanatory variables you chose reflect the crime type you are modeling? \n\n```{r eval=F}\n\"\nThe Type of Crime (Dependent Variable): Burglary\nVariables of Interest (Independent Variable):\nWeapons_Violation\nPercent_Less_than_High_School_Education_\nNumber_of_violent_crimes\nNumber_of_property_crimes\nVandalism\nPercent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household\nDisorderly_Conduct\n\nFor the number of Burglaries, I started with a set of related variables. for example, it seems that the increase in all of this variables can increase Vehicle Theft.\n\n# I first run these above variables in univariant regression against one another.\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Weapons_Violation ), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Weapons_Violation) , data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.3537,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.3526 \nF-statistic: 349.6 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ sqrt(Median_Rent_), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ Median_Rent_, data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  2.248e-05,\tAdjusted R-squared:  -0.001552 \nF-statistic: 0.01427 on 1 and 635 DF,  p-value: 0.9049\n\nplot(sqrt(chicago@data$Burglary) , (chicago@data$Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_))\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.0165,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.01496 \nF-statistic: 10.72 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: 0.001117\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Number_of_violent_crimes), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Number_of_violent_crimes), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.4443,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.4435 \nF-statistic:   511 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Number_of_property_crimes), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Number_of_property_crimes), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.3026,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.3015 \nF-statistic: 277.3 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Population_Density), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Population_Density), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.01085,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.009299 \nF-statistic: 7.007 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: 0.008319\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Vandalism), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Vandalism), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.6047,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.6041 \nF-statistic: 977.4 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ sqrt(Percent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Percent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.0744,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.07295 \nF-statistic: 51.36 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: 2.126e-12\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ sqrt(Percent_Employed_in_Service_Occupations), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ sqrt(Percent_Employed_in_Service_Occupations), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.4178,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.417 \nF-statistic: 472.3 on 1 and 658 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\nplot(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Disorderly_Conduct), data = chicago@data)\nviolent_crimes <- lm(sqrt(Burglary) ~ (Disorderly_Conduct ), data = chicago@data)\nsummary(violent_crimes)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.1987,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.1975 \nF-statistic: 158.5 on 1 and 639 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nMost of the variables are significant, in the first 'one to one' regression model test.

Pay special attention to the sign and significance of each variable. Do the predictors align with your intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the frequency of crime?\n\n```{r eval=F}\n\" To explain our crime type (number of Burglary here, we came up with three variable that can explain the variation of our model better. \n1) Percent_Less_than_High_School_Education_: this variable is significant, and its increase leads to deacreasing in the number of violent crime. This predictor does not align with my intuition about the association between social/economic characteristics and the number of Burglary. 2) Weapons_Violation is a significant variable too and with a positive coefficient has a direct relationship with number of Vehicle Theft.  3) vandalism was the most statistically significant variable of this model. This may be due to Burglary and vandalism as co-occurring events, as well as increasing escalation of crimes and/or opportunity for crime.\n\"\n```\n7-2- What shortcomings does your final model have? In what ways is the model's explanatory power limited? Does the model still violate assumptions of OLS regression (i.e. heteroskedasticity, residual [spatial]autocorrelation)? (Explain how these problems limit your ability to draw inferences about the crime type you chose.) How might the characteristics of the variables you chose influence these problems? [*]\n```{r eval=F}\n\"\nOur final model has a R-square of 0.6461 that is considered fine in a linear regression model, but still the model still violate assumptions of OLS regression. we still have heteroscedasticity and correlated residuals in our model. After examining the plots of residuals vs variables, the residuals for vandalism does not bounce randomly around the 0 line, it suggests that the assumption that the relationship is linear is not reasonable. But I ploted vandalism and Vehicle Theft together and it's clear that they have a very strong linear relationship. After using vandalism for two model, I think there is an issue in this variable that we cannot eliminate heteroscedasticity and correlated residuals in our model.\n\"\n```\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n## Model four: Weapons Violation\n\n### 1 - Variable Selection\n1-1- How do the explanatory variables you chose reflect the crime type you are modeling? \n\n```{r eval=F}\n\"\nThe Type of Crime (Dependent Variable): Weapons_Violation\nVariables of Interest (Independent Variable):\nNumber_of_violent_crimes\nNumber_of_property_crimes\nHomicides\nPercent_of_children_in_single_female_headed_household\nPCT_of_Households_with_cash_public_assistance\nDisorderly_Conduct\n\nFor the number of Weapons_Violation, I started with a set of related variables.

I general,  I do not see race variables (especially African Americans) as an an explicit and significant indicator for crime incidents in Chicago, as do other variables such as Drug Abuse and Vandalism. I only saw that hat as crime increases the percent Hispanic decreases that can be due to the due to the institutional racism. It seems that  poverty plays a larger role in crime than does race. In our dependent variables, we can observe crime clusters in the South and Northwestern portions of the city. I used crime variables as independent variables to investigate whether certain neighborhood-level attributes routinely with crime type of crime. I modeling our dependent variables (violent crime, vehicle theft, burglary and weapons violations), we can see a strong spatial relationship toward the co-occurrence of crimes such as vandalism, disorderly conduct, property theft, etc. For example, Burglary and Vandalism or Vehicle Theft and Drug Abuse had a shared spatial quality. Or perhaps that locations with high crime occurrences might have greater crime diversity. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect police to use data to inform their strategies and tactics on some tracts due to the co-occurrence of crimes, but it seems unfair to target individuals due to racial characteristics. It seems interesting to inverstigate the reasons of co-occurrence of some crimes.\n\"\n```",
